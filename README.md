## Introduction

Welcome to the Portland Adventure Center!

This project is a multi-page website that was designed for an imaginary event center located in Portland, OR to help showcase the front-end development skills we've learned throughout Module 4 of the Software Development bootcamp at [Coding Temple](https://www.codingtemple.com).

This ficticious site features the Portland Adventure Center, home of LEGO-Palooza 2025, a [LEGO](https://www.lego.com)-themed event for the month of February. It includes detailed information about the events, as well as the center itself and the various activities and services offered.

While LEGO-Palooza is "Technic-ally" an entirely made up event, it really shouldn't be... ðŸ˜‰

## Features

- Home page with an introduction to the event center
- Detailed event page for LEGO-Palooza 2025

- Location page with directions and hours
- Contact Us page with a contact form
